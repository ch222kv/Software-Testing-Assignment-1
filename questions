What is a unit? 


Explain what is different with TDD from ordinary testing?


What is an Oracle?

SOmeone needs to tell the Oracle what is right, either by the specification or some other way.

How does Unit Testing affect the SUT code?


Do all tests need asserts?


What is black box testing, white box testing? How are these related to writing unit tests?
Black box testing, examining the functionality without knowing how it is achieved. Without knowing anything about the internals.
White box testing, testing with knowledge of code internal workings. Tests are generated from source code.

When maintaining code covered by test cases constructed by Black Box versus White Box, which may suffer the most changes?
White box testing should suffer the most since it tests the actual lines of code and not just the behavior.

What is the purpose of unit-testing?
Uncovering errors

Show example(s) from code where you used Equivalence Partitioning and Boundary Value Analysis to construct the code


Show example(s) from code where you used Coverage to find new test-cases


If multiple tests are broken, which do I fix first?


What is the purpose of TDD?


Can we always have 100% code-coverage?


Explain different types of coverage criteria.


What is the purpose of mocking?


Does 100% coverage mean we are bug-free?
No

Does 100% MCDC coverage mean we are bug-free?
No

Why do we go for RED first?
Going for RED first means that we know that the test actually can fail. You could write a test that should fail, but doesn't for some reason. If we do not check it first, you are not testing it correctly.
